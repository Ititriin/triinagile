#### About
- this repo was to practice using Vue and understand how backend and frontend are tied
- the template was created by the school's teacher (VIKK). I made modifications to make the frontend show data from the database

#### Getting it to work
- open Greatsuccess and run the server on 3001 with the command 'npm run start:dev'
- right click on template folder inside Triinagile folder and choose 'open in terminal'
- run commands: npm install; npm run serve
- in case of errors, restart the computer, say prayers or curse but do not start deleting things
